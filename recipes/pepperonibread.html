        <h2>Let's make Pepperoni Bread!</h2>
        <p>I just really like baked stuff — although I do not eat a lot of it. But pepperoni bread is awesome! There are all kinds of variations and those with cheese are specially good. Plus, it has pepperoni, so what more do you want?!</p>

        <h3>Ingrients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 loaf (1 pound) frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced pepperoni</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 can (4 ounces) mushroom stems and pieces, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup pickled pepper rings</li>
            <li>1 medium green pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 can (2-1/4 ounces) sliced ripe olives</li>
            <li>1 can (15 ounces) pizza sauce</li></ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°. On a greased baking sheet, roll out dough into a 15x10-in. rectangle. In a small bowl, combine the egg yolks, Parmesan cheese, oil, parsley, oregano, garlic powder and pepper. Brush over the dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle with the pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, pepper rings, green pepper and olives. Roll up, jelly-roll style, starting with a long side; pinch seam to seal and tuck ends under.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position loaf with seam side down; brush with egg whites. Do not let rise. Bake until golden brown and dough is cooked through, 35-40 minutes. Warm the pizza sauce; serve with sliced loaf.
            </li>
            <li>
                Freeze option: Freeze cooled unsliced pizza loaf in heavy-duty foil. To use, remove from freezer 30 minutes before reheating. Remove from foil and reheat loaf on a greased baking sheet in a preheated 325° oven until heated through. Serve as directed.
